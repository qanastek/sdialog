Synthetic Dialogue Generation with SDialog
==========================================

Conversational AI research and applications increasingly rely on high-quality, flexible, and reproducible synthetic dialogues for training, evaluation, and benchmarking. However, generating such dialogues presents several challenges:

- **Standardization:** There is a lack of standard definitions for dialogue, persona, and event structures, making it difficult to compare results across systems or datasets.
- **Abstraction:** Researchers and developers need abstract interfaces for dialogue generation that support both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, enabling modular experimentation.
- **Fine-grained Control:** Realistic dialogue simulation often requires fine-grained orchestration, such as injecting instructions, simulating user behaviors, or enforcing scenario constraints.
- **LLM Integration:** Leveraging instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for dialogue generation requires seamless integration, prompt management, and memory handling.
- **Scenario and Dataset Management:** Managing complex scenarios, flowcharts, and persona definitions is essential for reproducible research and controlled experimentation.

`SDialog <https://github.com/idiap/sdialog>`__ addresses these needs by providing a comprehensive, extensible framework for synthetic dialogue generation and analysis, supporting:

- **Persona-based role-playing** with LLMs for realistic, diverse conversations.
- **Multi-agent and orchestrated dialogues** for complex, scenario-driven simulations.
- **Scenario and dataset integration** for reproducible research and benchmarking.
- **Flexible serialization and visualization** for downstream tasks and analysis.
- **Custom orchestration and extensibility** for advanced research and experimentation.

Whether you are building conversational datasets, evaluating dialogue models, or experimenting with new conversational AI techniques, SDialog offers the abstractions and tools you need.
